# Project Description
We will develop a parallel algorithm that converts English character input of Japanese words into all of its respective Japanese alphabet representation using C++. We will then benchmark this algorithm qualitatively with multiple robust conversion APIs, Appleâ€™s auto-conversion, and quantitatively with a naive sequential algorithm to see effectiveness and gain insight into possible improvements.
