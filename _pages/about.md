# Project Description
We implemented and parallelized character conversion from the English alphabet to the Japanese alphabet. We compared the performance of a naive sequential approach and two parallel approaches on the Gates cluster machines and the PSC BRIDGES-2 supercomputer. We achieved over 10x speedup on the PSC machines for large text inputs and 4x speedup for midsize text inputs, as well as a 6.29x speedup on basic examples on the GHC machines.
